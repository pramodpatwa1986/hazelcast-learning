Searching in map can be done using predicate. Example could be creating predicate for less than and greater then join then by using and predicate and pass and predicate to imap using map.values(andpredicate).

Another way to swarch is using SQL predicates. it supports both = like and other opertion to search in imap

Index is required to be set using either post construct or MapIndex configuration. set true is required when you would like to sort for range query
